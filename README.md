# Retina CSS Sprite Generator
Webpage to generate CSS sprites for both normal and double-density displays.

[Use the Retina CSS Sprite Generator](https://italrap.github.io/Retina-CSS-Sprite-Generator-GoogleMap/)

If your image sizes are greater than 400kb each, you may want to consider compressing them first to avoid
potentially severe performance loss while using the generator.
